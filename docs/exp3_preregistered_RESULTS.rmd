# Results

## Participants

`r E3.raw_df$subj_id%>%unique()%>%length()` participants took part. Participants were excluded if their accuracy fell below 50% (0 participants). We also excluded participants for having extremely fast (`r E3.too_fast%>%length()` participants) or slow (`r E3.too_slow%>%length()` participants) reaction times in one or more of the tasks (below 100 milliseconds or above 5 seconds in more than 25% of the trials). 

Trials with response time below 100 milliseconds (`r (E3.raw_df%>%filter(RT<100)%>%nrow()/E3.raw_df%>%filter(RT>0)%>%nrow())%>%printnum()` of all trials) or above 7 seconds (`r (E3.raw_df%>%filter(RT>7000)%>%nrow()/E3.raw_df%>%filter(RT>0)%>%nrow())%>%printnum()` of all trials) were excluded from the response-time analysis.

### Hypotheses and analysis plan

This study is designed to test the timing of decisions to terminate evidence accumulation in the absence of a target as a function of stimulus occlusion.

```{r H1, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

E3.RT_by_resp <- E3.df %>%
  filter((test_part=='test1' | test_part=='test2') & RT>100 & RT<7000) %>%
  group_by(subj_id,resp) %>%
  summarise(RT=median(RT))%>%
  spread(resp,RT,sep='')%>%
  mutate(diff=respTRUE-respFALSE)


```

*Hypothesis 1 (PRESENCE/ABSENCE RESPONSE TIME)*: We tested the null hypothesis that response times are similar for target-absent and target-present responses, aiming to replicate the finding that decisions about the absence of a target are slower than decisions about its presence [@mazor2021metacognitive; @mazor2020distinct]. 

A paired t-test on the median individual level-response times revealed a significant difference (`r apa_print(E3.RT_by_resp%>%pull(diff)%>%t.test())$full_result`). 

```{r H2, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

E3.RT_by_occlusion_in_presence_correct_only <- E3.df %>%
  filter((test_part=='test1' | test_part=='test2') & RT>100  & RT<7000 & resp & correct) %>%
  group_by(subj_id,hide_proportion) %>%
  summarise(RT=median(RT))%>%
  spread(hide_proportion,RT,sep='')%>%
  mutate(diff=hide_proportion0.1-hide_proportion0.35);

```

*Hypothesis 2 (OCCLUSION EFFECT IN PRESENCE)*: We tested the null hypothesis that target-present response times are similar when 2 or 6 pixel rows are occluded. 

A paired t-test on the median individual level-response times in correct trials only revealed a significant difference (`r apa_print(E3.RT_by_occlusion_in_presence_correct_only%>%pull(diff)%>%t.test())$full_result`).

```{r H3, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

E3.RT_by_occlusion_in_absence_correct_only <- E3.df %>%
  filter((test_part=='test1' | test_part=='test2') & RT>100  & RT<7000 & !resp & correct) %>%
  group_by(subj_id,hide_proportion) %>%
  summarise(RT=median(RT))%>%
  spread(hide_proportion,RT,sep='')%>%
  mutate(diff=hide_proportion0.1-hide_proportion0.35);

```

*Hypothesis 3 (OCCLUSION EFFECT IN ABSENCE)*: We tested the null hypothesis that response times in target-absent responses are similar when 2 or 6 pixel rows are occluded. 

A paired t-test on the median individual level-response times in correct trials only revealed a null effect (`r apa_print(E3.RT_by_occlusion_in_absence_correct_only%>%pull(diff)%>%t.test())$full_result`).

```{r H4, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

E3.RT_by_occlusion_and_response_correct_only <- merge(
  E3.RT_by_occlusion_in_presence_correct_only,
  E3.RT_by_occlusion_in_absence_correct_only,
  by= 'subj_id',
  suffixes = c('presence','absence')) %>%
  mutate(interaction = diffpresence-diffabsence);
```

*Hypothesis 4 (OCCLUSION RESPONSE INTERACTION)*: We tested the null hypothesis that the effect of occlusion on reaction time is similar in target-absent and target-present responses, by performing a group-level t-test on the subject-level contrast $(median(RT_{P,2})-median(RT_{P,6}))-(median(RT_{A,2})-median(RT_{A,6}))$ Where $P$ and $A$ stand for present and absent, and 2 and 6 represent the number of occluded rows. Here too, analysis was restricted to correct trials only.

We find a significant interaction (`r apa_print(E3.RT_by_occlusion_and_response_correct_only%>%pull(interaction)%>%t.test())$full_result`). 

```{r SDT, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

E3.descriptives_by_occlusion<- E3.df %>%
  filter(test_part=='test1' | test_part=='test2') %>%
  mutate(resp = response==presence_key)%>%
  group_by(subj_id,hide_proportion) %>%
  summarise(accuracy=mean(correct),
            resp_bias=mean(resp),
            RT=median(RT),
            hit_rate = (sum(correct & present)+0.5)/(sum(present)+1),
            fa_rate = (sum(!correct & !present)+0.5)/(sum(!present)+1),
            d = qnorm(hit_rate)-qnorm(fa_rate),
            c = -0.5*(qnorm(hit_rate)+qnorm(fa_rate)))
```

*Hypothesis 5 (SENSITIVITY)*: We tested the null hypothesis that perceptual sensitivity (measured as $d'=z(H)-z(F)$) is equal as a function of the proportion of hidden pixels. To allow the extraction of d' for participants who committed no false-alarms or misses, we added 0.5 to miss, hit, false-alarm and correct rejection counts [@snodgrass1988pragmatics].

We find a significant drop in d' as a function of occlusion (`r apa_print(E3.descriptives_by_occlusion %>% group_by(subj_id) %>% summarise(diff=d[hide_proportion==0.10]-d[hide_proportion>0.3])%>%pull(diff)%>%t.test())$full_result`)

*Hypothesis 6 (CRITERION)*: We tested the null hypothesis that decision criterion (measured as $c=-0.5(z(H)+z(F))$) is unaffected by the proportion of hidden pixels. To allow the extraction of a decision criterion for participants who committed no false-alarms or misses, we added 0.5 to miss, hit, false-alarm and correct rejection counts [@snodgrass1988pragmatics].

We find a significantly more conservative criterion in high-occlusion trials (`r apa_print(E3.descriptives_by_occlusion %>% group_by(subj_id) %>% summarise(diff=c[hide_proportion==0.1]-c[hide_proportion>0.3])%>%pull(diff)%>%t.test())$full_result`).
